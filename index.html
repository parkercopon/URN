              I was biking with my dad to visit the great river in our city. It's a very long, very thin, national park. It's beautiful. On the way there, I accidentally braked (broke?) too hard and scraped my hands, knee, and hip. It was the first time I had been scraped in years, and I was bleeding. Not too much, just a little. It felt scary for a moment. Then I realized, I could change how I felt about it. I decided that the pain felt good, and that I needed the pain, after going to long without getting hurt. And you know what? It didn't hurt less, but it was more... bearable.<br>14/08/24

          <br>It's "Johann Sebastian." Legend says that a musician once challenged him to a musical duel, where one aristocrat would play their instrument, then another would play, and whoever was in the tavern at the time would watch and decide who was better. This duelist, when he heard Bach merely warming up his fingers, left the tavern without playing anything.

    <h4>CLOSING THOUGHTSSSS</h4>
    <p>Sometimes in my life I feel like the smartest coolest person the world, or like I'm living in my own world that was built for me. I can become arrogant and waste your time. I am sorry if we meet and I do this to you. Always keep living!! Live with urgency and gusto and full of love for everything. Never be arrogant; there is no one to be arrogant to. Think hard about your thinking, and you will not go wrong. Love you!!!<3  
    <br>As I'm writing this I'm 19. I still have a long time to live, yet my life is so short. "Such is the human experience..."
    <br>The connections you make, the friends you find, the love you share, will outlive you. It's our legacy. Always love people.</p>
